# Anime4K

Anime4K is a set of open-source, high-quality real-time anime upscaling/denoising algorithms that can be implemented in any programming language.

The simplicty and speed of Anime4K allows the user to watch upscaled anime in real time, as we believe in preserving original content and promoting freedom of choice for all anime fans. Re-encoding anime into 4K should be avoided as it is non-reversible, potentially damages original content by introducing artifacts, takes up to O(n^2) more disk space and more importantly, does so without any meaningful decrease in entropy (lost information is lost).

### A Few Comparisons (1080p to 4K Upscaling)
**Denoising is enabled when possible. (Anime4K, waifu2x and NGU)**
